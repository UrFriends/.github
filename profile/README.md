# UrFriends!

Thank you for taking interest in UrFriends

The goal of this app is to help people to build and maintain relationships

The initial concept was inspired by things like:

- Benjamin Franklin's daily routines
- Bill Clinton's uncanny "ability" to recall names, faces, and conversations (He and his team kept detailed notes on everyone he met)
- Marcus Aurelius's Meditations... was his personal journal
- My grandmother Faye, who had an immense social circle and maintained it with a cheap address book and a landline
- The non-interaction that has come with many contemporary forms of social media

Here is an initial concept illustration:
